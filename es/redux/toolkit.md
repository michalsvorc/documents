# API



* [configureStore()](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/configureStore): wraps createStore to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults. It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply, includes **redux-thunk** by default, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension.
* [createReducer()](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createReducer): that lets you supply a lookup table of action types to case reducer functions, rather than writing switch statements. In addition, it automatically uses the [immer library](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) to let you write simpler immutable updates with normal mutative code, like state.todos[3].completed = true.
* [createAction()](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAction): generates an action creator function for the given action type string. The function itself has toString() defined, so that it can be used in place of the type constant.
* [createSlice()](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice): accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types.
* [createAsyncThunk](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk): accepts an action type string and a function that returns a promise, and generates a thunk that dispatches pending/fulfilled/rejected action types based on that promise
* [createEntityAdapter](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createEntityAdapter): generates a set of reusable reducers and selectors to manage normalized data in the store
* The [createSelector utility](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSelector) from the [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) library, re-exported for ease of use.
